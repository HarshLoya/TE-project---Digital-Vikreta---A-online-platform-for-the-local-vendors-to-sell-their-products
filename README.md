# TE-project---Digital-Vikreta---A-online-platform-for-the-local-vendors-to-sell-their-products
This is my third year project. In this project we had developed a web app using reactjs and nodejs in order to create a online platform where local vendors can sell their product locally as well as globally.

# Overview
<br>
The envisioned web application for local vendors to sell their products online and manage inventory will encompass a comprehensive set of features tailored to their needs. Central to this platform is user authentication and profile management, facilitating secure registration and login processes for vendors while maintaining essential business information such as contact details and product categories. Through intuitive product management functionalities, vendors can seamlessly add, edit, and remove products, with customizable fields including descriptions, prices, quantities, and images. Crucially, robust inventory management capabilities ensure real-time tracking of stock levels, preempting issues of overselling and providing alerts for low stock quantities. Seamless order management tools empower vendors to oversee orders for their products, with features encompassing order status updates, tracking information dissemination, and the generation of invoices and packing slips. The shopping cart and checkout system offer customers a frictionless purchasing experience, integrating multiple payment gateways and facilitating secure transactions. Integration with shipping carriers streamlines the shipping and delivery process, while reporting and analytics functionalities provide vendors with valuable insights into sales performance, inventory turnover, and customer behavior. Effective communication channels between vendors and customers, coupled with robust security measures and compliance with data protection regulations, underpin the platform's reliability and trustworthiness. Embracing responsive design principles ensures accessibility across various devices, while scalability and maintenance considerations ensure the platform's continued efficacy and relevance as vendors and product offerings expand over time. Ultimately, this web application serves as a dynamic and indispensable tool for local vendors, empowering them to showcase their products effectively, streamline operations, and thrive in the digital marketplace.
